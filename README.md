# 👋 Hi there!

### Senior Blockchain / Protocol Engineer

📧 [piyushgx0@gmail.com](mailto:piyushgx0@gmail.com )

---

Blockchain engineer with 4+ years of hands-on experience building production-grade decentralized systems across EVM, Tendermint, and Avalanche-based chains. I specialize in protocol engineering, smart contracts, rollups, and DeFi infrastructure, with a strong focus on security, performance, and correctness.

I’ve worked on custom L1s and L2s, Tendermint-based micro-rollups, perpetual settlement systems, cross-chain messaging, and oracle integrations. My background spans chain-level development, consensus mechanisms, and on-chain/off-chain data pipelines, including debugging and stabilizing mainnet systems under real production load.

I enjoy working close to the protocol layer. designing systems that handle real value, scaling decentralized infrastructure, and solving hard distributed systems problems.
