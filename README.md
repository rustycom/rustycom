### 💼 Professional Experience

#### **Senior Blockchain Engineer – SecFinance ** (April 2023 - Present)
- ●  Architected  and maintained Solidity smart contracts for DeFi modules, including vaults, bridges, and 
perpetuals, on EVM-compatible chains. 
- ●  Built a Go-based cross-chain relayer integrating Ethereum and Substrate; utilized event indexing, finality 
confirmation logic, and consensus-based forwarding. 
- ●  Engineered  Rust-based  cross-chain  relayer  services  using  Actix  +  Tokio,  implementing  async 
concurrency models, bounded queues, and retries with exponential backoff for reliable message passing 
between Ethereum and Cosmos chains. 
- ●  Built CosmWasm contracts in Rust for vaults and governance modules, leveraging multi-contract entry 
points  and optimizing storage access patterns with 
- ●  Developed  and maintained a Gas Tank system (Go backend + Solidity hooks) supporting sponsored 
transactions via ERC-2771-style meta txns. 
- ●  Designed EIP-712 based signature schemes for off-chain trade submission, integrated with Go servers for 
batch verification and settlement. 
- ●  Developed  Rust-based  indexers  with  async  gRPC  +  JSON-RPC  clients,  implementing Merkle proof 
verification and efficient state sync pipelines for validator and oracle data. 
- ●  Built  Go  orchestrators  to  manage dynamic microservices (indexers, validators, simulators) based on 
contract state triggers. 
- ●  Designed and deployed order book matching logic across Solidity and Go, with hybrid execution for 
speed and on-chain settlement. 
- ●  Integrated Chainlink/Pyth oracle feeds for pricing data with fallback mechanisms and time-weighted 
price validation. 
- ●  Researched and mitigated MEV risks across trade settlement and liquidation flows via delayed reveal 
and transaction simulation. 
- ●  Conducted  internal  audits  for  Solidity  contracts,  preventing  reentrancy,  overflow/underflow,  and 
signature forgery vulnerabilities. 
- ●  Contributed to NFT-based tools, including lending platforms and fractional ownership protocols with 
Solidity + Go architecture. 
- ●  Employed  libp2p  and  custom  Go  messaging  layers  to  synchronize  validator updates and enhance 
relayer security.

#### **Blockchain Engineer – MovoCash ** (December 2020 - February 2023)
- ●  Developed  Solidity  contracts  for  modular  DeFi  systems:  vaults,  AMMs,  NFT  marketplaces,  and 
governance modules. 
- ●  Implemented custom Substrate pallets in Rust for staking and reward distribution, leveraging FRAME 
macros and offchain workers for validator set updates. 
- ●  Integrated Solidity contracts with Go-based backends and indexers, enabling real-time event syncing 
and stateful analytics. 
- ●  Designed Rust-based event processors with and streaming RPC, reducing block sync latency across 
Cosmos ↔ Ethereum bridge adapters by ~25%. 
- ●  Built a Go REST API layer for trading frontends to consume indexed on-chain data and relay batched 
transactions to the contracts. 
- ●  Engineered cross-chain asset tracking flows, integrating Cosmos SDK-based chains with Solidity smart 
contracts via Go adapters. 
- ●  Designed and deployed position vaults with liquidation logic and margin-based collateral management 
in Solidity. 
- ●  Created internal tools for log decoding, event parsing, and alerting systems using Go for contract 
observability. 
- ●  Wrote extensive tests using Hardhat and Foundry, simulating edge conditions and flashloan-based 
exploits. 
- ●  Collaborated with DevOps and frontend teams to maintain smooth deployment, observability, and 
rollouts.
