### üíº Professional Experience

#### Senior Blockchain Engineer ‚Äì SecFinance  (April 2023 - Present)
- As a Blockchain Developer with extensive experience in both Solidity and Go, I have a proven track record of architecting, building, and maintaining secure, scalable, and high-performance decentralized systems. I have developed DeFi modules including vaults, bridges, and perpetuals, and built robust cross-chain relayers using Go and Rust to enable reliable message passing between chains like Ethereum, Cosmos, and Substrate. My expertise extends to designing gas-tank systems for sponsored transactions, implementing off-chain EIP-712 signature schemes for efficient trade settlement, and creating hybrid order book engines with on-chain settlement. I'm skilled in building Rust-based indexers with Merkle proof verification and designing Go-based orchestrators to manage microservices. Additionally, I've conducted internal security audits to mitigate common smart contract vulnerabilities and have integrated various oracle feeds while researching and mitigating MEV risks. My work also includes contributions to NFT-based lending platforms and fractional ownership protocols, demonstrating my versatility in the Web3 ecosystem.

#### Blockchain Engineer ‚Äì MovoCash  (December 2020 - February 2023)
- As a blockchain developer, I've leveraged my expertise in Solidity, Rust, and Go to build and maintain robust decentralized systems. My experience includes developing modular DeFi systems for vaults, AMMs, and NFT marketplaces, as well as implementing custom Substrate pallets for staking and reward distribution. I'm skilled in creating seamless integrations between Solidity contracts and Go-based backends, designing high-performance Rust-based event processors, and engineering cross-chain asset tracking flows between Cosmos and Ethereum. Additionally, I've built internal tools for contract observability and have a strong focus on security, writing extensive tests to simulate flashloan attacks and other exploits. My collaborative skills enable me to work effectively with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth deployments and rollouts.
